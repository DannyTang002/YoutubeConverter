This is a django based webbaplication used to turn a youtube url into a mp3/mp4 file

There are some problems with this project, so i will probably have to restart. First of all what im trying to do is completly build this application based on django alone, so its all server side. Next time i will need to add a frontend framework on top of django and make it more clientside-friedly.
